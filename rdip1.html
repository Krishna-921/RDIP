            <h1> Introduction To HTML </h1>
            
                <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                 HTML describes the structure of a Web page                 HTML consists of a series of elements                 HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page
                 HTML, as a markup language doesn't really “do” anything in the sense that a programming language does. HTML contains no programming logic. It doesn't have common conditional statements such as If/Else. ... This is because HTML is not a programming language.
